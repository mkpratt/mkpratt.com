        "long-description": "Friendability is a social media website that connects people based on personality and location. Friendability strives to make more meaningful relationships instead of connecting you with people you will hardly want to intereact with. Built using a MEAN stack with a PUG view manager, this website also uses a Parse Server (parseplatform.org) as a shared non-relational mongodb for access across multiple platforms. Current platforms in use include Desktop and iOS devices (friendability iOS app). Friendability is a social media website that connects users with similar personalities. The Parse Server platform was chosen because of the ability to use it across platforms as well as a very explicit SDKs for both iOS and web technologies like Node. The Parse Server gives a very easy to integrate API which is nice for a social media website. This website also utilizes Amazon's AWS and is running on an EC2 instance. The current website only shows a landing page with a terms of use, privacy policies, and a way to contact Friendability owners at the moment, but other fundamental parts (like login and profile navigation) are under construction.",

This website gives the recommenders an easy way to fill out and submit their recommendations. It is also possible for applicants to request grade predictions from instructors with whose courses they are enrolled. The instructors have a simple dashboard with which they can submit their grade predictions for the applicants. For faculty and administrators on the receiving end of the application, this website also gives them a dashboard to manage the submitted applications for review.
