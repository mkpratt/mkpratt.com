Friendability is a social media platform that will create meaningful relationships without shoving mindless content into the user's life.</p><h1>Solution</h1><p>The user is connected with people based on their personality and interests. The user takes an initial questionnaire to determine their personality type to begin connecting them with people who have similar personalities.</p><h1>Product</h1><p>Friendabilty is currently being developed for the iPhone. It also allows users to have a desktop web application profile with which they can perform basic social media and profile functionalities.</p>",
