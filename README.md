This project was initialized with <b>Express</b> and uses a <b>PUG view manager</b> and <b>Node</b> routing. This website features an alive parallax space environment with custom <b>3D</b> objects made possible by <b>THREE.js</b> and <b>WebGL</b>. Most of the 3D objects were custom built in <b>Blender</b>. These custom 3D objects utilize <b>UV mapped textures</b>. This website is mostly experimental in which I can give the vistor an experience different from most generic websites. The design for this website was made in collaboration with <a href="//www.garthpratt.com">Garth Pratt</a>.
