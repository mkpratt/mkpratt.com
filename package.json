This website features an alive parallax space environment with custom <b>3D</b> objects made possible by <b>THREE.js</b> and <b>WebGL</b>. Most of the 3D objects were custom built in <b>Blender</b>. These custom 3D objects utilize <b>UV mapped textures</b>. This website is mostly experimental in which I can give the vistor an experience different from most generic websites. The design for this website was made in collaboration with <a href=\"//www.garthpratt.com\">Garth Pratt</a>.",
