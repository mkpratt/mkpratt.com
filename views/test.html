<h1>Problem</h1><p>Developers for the university websites have mixed knowledge of design standards.<br />Implementation of design standards was complicated and varied with each website.<br />No central library for developers to pull common university resources.</p><h1>End Goal</h1><p>We wanted to make even the most novice of developers write code like pros. By synthesizing hundreds of lines of code into one simple element, developers can maximize productivity within the defined brand guidelines.</p><h1>Solution</h1><p>Using the latest web technology, web components offer an easy and simple solution to creating custom HTML elements with scoped styles. These custom web components integrate seamlessly into any website and are compatible with all the major web browsers. For those browsers that don’t have full support for web components yet (e.g. Edge and IE11), the use of polyfills built into our content delivery network provide that functionality.</p><h1>Product</h1><p>Sites implementing the new web components:<br><a>www.byu.edu</a><a>math.byu.edu</a><a>speeches.byu.edu</a><a>map.byu.edu</a><a>arcmap.byu.edu</a><a>gradstudies.byu.edu</a><a>calendar.byu.edu</a><a>homecoming.byu.edu</a><a>photo.byu.edu</a><a>news.byu.edu</a><a>webcommunity.byu.edu</a><a>hs.byu.edu</a><a>ccc.byu.edu</a><a>campusfloral.byu.edu</a><a>brand.byu.edu</a><a>dpd.byu.edu</a><a>genomes.byu.edu</a><a>ctl.byu.edu</a><a>ece.byu.edu</a><a>cdn.byu.edu</a><a>sustainability-dev.byu.edu</a><a>compliance-stg.byu.edu</a><a>www3-etdev.et.byu.edu</a><a>greenteam-dev.byu.edu</a><a>www3-ceen.et.byu.edu</a>…etc etc.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1><p>There are so many social media sites that are desperately trying to grab our attention with anything and everything. It drowns out the experience of what social media sites are in theory designed to offer us, that is, meaningful connections with people we care about. With all these different social media platforms that shove meaningless content into our brains, the meaningful relationships and social interactions are forgotten and left behind.</p><h1>End Goal</h1><p>Friendability wants to connect you with people you care about or actually want to get to know and get along with. Friendability is a social media platform that will create meaningful relationships without shoving mindless content into your life.</p><h1>Solution</h1><p>You are connected with people based on your personalities and interests. By letting the app get to know who you are and things you like, you will become connected to those that share similar interests. Users will be given an initial questionnaire to begin connecting you as soon as possible.</p><h1>Product</h1><p>Friendabilty is currently being developed for the iPhone. It also allows users to have adesktop web application profile with which they can perform basic profile functionalities.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1><p>The application to the Dietetics Program at Brigham Young University has been around for a very long time. A few years ago, a website was created to help simplify that process. Over the years, the technology with which the website was written is struggling to keep up. Not to mention the user interface for the application was dull and complicated to work with providing a difficult user experience.</p><h1>End Goal</h1><p>To make the application process simple and easy to understand. Applicants can track their progress easily and know exactly what the Dietetics Program requires. The faculty in charge of reviewing the applications will have a clear view of the applicants which will efficiently and effectively help the review process.</p><h1>Solution</h1><p>Build a simple user interface that cleanly displays information to the user. Applicants will have an application dashboard with their current applications. Applications are organized into sections that are easy to fill out and submit for review. Faculty are likewise given a faculty dashboard that displays all immediate pertinant information and can navigate to view applications in greater detail.</p><h1>Product</h1><p>The application to the Dietetics Program at BYU is currently published at dpd.byu.edu.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1><p>Professors for the College of Life Sciences at BYU have a passion for research. One professor in particular has a vast library of genomic research data with which he would like to share with the world, but has had no current medium with which to upload and post his research. Genomes are complex and hard to understand. The data collected by this professor for any particular genome can have an enormous amount of data to sift through and to find important pieces of information.</p><h1>End Goal</h1><p>Provide an online database that can accept large amounts of genome information. Display the most important pieces of information on a genomic profile that is visible to the public. Provide links for any user on the genomic profile to download the data for more in depth research.</p><h1>Solution</h1><p>The Genome Assembly Database has an Admin accessible portal to upload the new data collected from research. The website will parse the given data, pull out the important pieces, and display the the simplifed data on a genomic profile. Anyone visiting the site will have access to these profiles and can download the more complex data.</p><h1>Product</h1><p>The Genome Assembly Database website is published at genomes.byu.edu.</p>


Friendabilty
Friendability is a social media website that connects people based on personality and location. 
Friendability strives to make more meaningful relationships instead of connecting you with people 
you will hardly want to intereact with. Built using a MEAN stack with a PUG view manager, 
this website also uses a Parse Server (parseplatform.org) as a shared non-relational mongodb 
for access across multiple platforms. Current platforms in use include Desktop and iOS devices 
(friendability iOS app). Friendability is a social media website that connects users with similar 
personalities. The Parse Server platform was chosen because of the ability to use it across platforms 
as well as a very explicit SDKs for both iOS and web technologies like Node. The Parse Server gives a 
very easy to integrate API which is nice for a social media website. This website also utilizes Amazon's 
AWS and is running on an EC2 instance. The current website only shows a landing page with a terms of use, 
privacy policies, and a way to contact Friendability owners at the moment, but other fundamental parts 
(like login and profile navigation) are under construction.

DPD
This website was redesigned with the intent to simplify the process for applicants that apply to the DPD program in BYU's field of Dietetics, as well as to simplify and optimize the work for those on the receiving end of the application. This site allows for the applicants to have a simple interface as well as a clearly laid out application process and results. The applicants need to supply 2 recommenders to fill out recommendations. This website gives the recommenders an easy way to fill out and submit their recommendations. It is also possible for applicants to request grade predictions from instructors with whose courses they are enrolled. The instructors have a simple dashboard with which they can submit their grade predictions for the applicants. For faculty and administrators on the receiving end of the application, this website also gives them a dashboard to manage the submitted applications for review. This website follows BYU's standards for web design.

Genomes
The Genome Assembly Database allows for researchers to upload their data and for their data to be easily accessible by anyone. This website allows the researchers to upload their files which are then parsed into a more readable format. These files can be downloaded for a more in depth coverage of the genomes.
